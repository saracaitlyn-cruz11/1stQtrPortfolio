# Quarter 1 Reflections

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

- **Relational Operators** : these operators that are used in order to compare two values; some of these operators are >, <, ==, and !=. I understand this well because they were pretty similar as to the ones used in C++. We had many many exercises and discussiosn last school year about this topic, hence it was simple to recall these.

- **Arithmetic Operators**:  these operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations; these include addition, subtraction, mulitplication,division, and modulus. I know how to use them since they work just like regular math, and they were also used in C++ already.
- 
- **Different JavaScript Terms**: In class, we learned different JavaScript-related terms that are important in coding. These include things like keywords, identifiers, constants, expressions, and statements. Knowing these terms helps me understand the structure of code and communicate about it more clearly. 
  
- **Declaration of Variables**:In JavaScript, this can be done using var, let, or const. I understand how to declare variables and assign values to them, and I can explain when to use each depending on the situation. 
  
- **Data Types** : There was a very extensive discussion about the different data types during this quarter. Moreover, many data types used in the Java Script are similar to C++. The other more complex ones were used extensively in many examples during clas.

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

- **Conditional Statements**: I know how many of these conditional statements work (such as if statements, if else, etc.), but I still need more practice in applying them to real coding exercises. I get confused when using multiple conditions at the same time, especially with nested if statements. I also mix up the order of conditions, which sometimes changes the outcome of the program. Much more practice will help me understand the flow better and how to properly sequence.

- **Declaring/Calling Functions**: As a topic I also struggled with last year, I had to really listen to the discussions for this. I understand the idea of functions, but I  forget the propoer syntax and how to properly call them. For example, I need more practice in passing parameters, and returning values. I also want to get better at calling functions, but I often forge to do so. More practice and a few more discussions, again, would help with this.

- **Loop Control Structure**: I get the concept of loops structures (while, do while, switch statements), but I need more examples and practice to avoid confusion, especially with, again, propoer syntaxing and accidentally creating infinite loops. I sometimes forget when to use a for loop, a while loop, or a do-while loop. Also, I want to practice using break and continue correctly to better control loops.

- Input Outpu Statements

- **String Manipulation**: I know the basic concept of strings, but I need more practice in using string methods and operations. Sometimes I forget which function to use when I want to find, replace, or modify parts of a string. More examples and exercises would help me become more confident in working with text in JavaScript.

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
To improve in these areas, I will be studious and review my  notes and sample codes constantly given to us during class to refresh the idea and concepts in my mind.I will also try to practice myself with coding exercises, until I get the hang of it all. And the most effective one would be to read the learning guides in advance, and watching tutorials on youtube and such to see how specific things work (such as calling functions, proper syntax, etc.). And when all fails, of course, we ask for the guidace from Ma'am by asking questions about the topic. This will all be done in order to help myself further understand the topics until I am confident in them.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

Effective:
- The coding exercises where we solved problems step by step were effective because they let me apply the lessons directly.
- Speed-tests were effective for me as they tested how fast we grasped the topic and were able to apply them.

Not Effective:
- Kahoot: Although it was a fun game, it was a bit hard to keep up (due to the timer) with the more complex questions, and it's a bit harder to review Kahoot games.
- Some short lectures without examples were not very helpful since I learn better when I see the code in action.
